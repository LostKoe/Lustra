## What is Lustra?

Lustra is a CSS Framework and Library created by [LostKoe](https://github.com/LostKoe).
It is inspired by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), so some styles may look familiar â€” but Lustra has its own identity.

With Lustra, you can use done components, use classes for single styles and style Lustra's default style. And with all of this you'll be ready to give bright for your Frontend website.

## Why use Lustra?

1. **No conflicts** â€“ All classes start with `ls-`, so they wonâ€™t conflict with other frameworks or libraries.
2. **Clean design** â€“ Simple appearance with smooth transitions, perfect for those who like minimalism.
3. **Lightweight** â€“ Super fast to load, no heavy dependencies.
4. **Flexible** â€“ Youâ€™re free to override Lustraâ€™s styles whenever you want.

## Getting started (soon!)

## First steps

After adding the CDN links, here are some tips to get started:

1. **Check the Docs** (coming soon in version 1.0.0). The docs will include examples and snippets you can copy and customize.
2. **Always use `ls-` classes**. For example:
    ```html
    <button class="ls-btn ls-btn-primary">Click me</button>
    ```

    This ensures you're using Lustra's system and avoids conflicts.
3. **Code whatever you want**
