## About Lustra

Lustra is a CSS Framework made by only one young brazilian person, [LostKoe](https://github.com/LostKoe), and I'm not gonna lie, this was the most difficult project I ever made and thought about, I restarted it many and many times, but now I'll try not to do that, because Lustra won't go foward like that.

### Why Lustra?

Here are some reasons you should consider about using Lustra:

- **No complication with others Frameworks;** Lustra always has a prefix `ls-` in classes, attributes and others, so there won't have any problems with others things.
- **Easy to understand;** All classes names, components and more has names, and their names I made to be really direct to the point, so you won't need to think for hours about what something means.
- **Always able for new updates;** So Lustra won't have only some styles for a long time, it'll have more and constant updates.

### Why did I made this?

I made this Framework for some reasons:

1. I didn't have any good ideia of a new project (I know this reason is bad, but it's true).
2. CSS Frameworks were too difficult to understand, and I wanted an easier one to understand.
3. Famous Frameworks had some styles a bit too overcomplicated, and not everyone wanted styles like that.
4. I wanted to practice my habilities in developing huge things.

### Made with

Lustra had some tools that helped in making it, and here is some of them:
