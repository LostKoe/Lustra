## What is Lustra?

Lustra is a CSS Framework and Library created by [LostKoe](https://github.com/LostKoe).
It is inspired by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), so some styles may look familiar â€” but Lustra has its own identity.

With Lustra, you get **ready-to-use components, clean styles, lightness, and simplicity**, all designed to make your frontend development easier.

## Why use Lustra?

1. **No conflicts** â€“ All classes start with `ls-`, so they wonâ€™t conflict with other frameworks or libraries.
2. **Clean design** â€“ Simple appearance with smooth transitions, perfect for those who like minimalism.
3. **Lightweight** â€“ Super fast to load, no heavy dependencies.
4. **Flexible** â€“ Youâ€™re free to override Lustraâ€™s styles whenever you want.

## Getting started

To start using Lustra, youâ€™ll need to add **two CDN links** into your project.

### CSS link
Add this inside your `<head>` tag:
```html
<link href="https://lostkoe.github.io/Lustra/lustra/1.0.0/css/main.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### JS link
Add this inside your `<body>` tag:
```html
<script src="https://lostkoe.github.io/Lustra/1.0.0/js/main.js" type="module"></script>
```

- The CSS file provides ready-made styles and components.
- The JS file enables interactivity for components and makes some features easier than plain CSS.

You'll probably need both for everything to work as expected.

## First steps

After adding the CDN links, here are some tips to get started:

1. **Check the Docs** (coming soon in version 1.0.0). The docs will include examples and snippets you can copy and customize.
2. **Always use `ls-` classes**. For example:
    ```html
    <div class="ls-alert ls-alert-sucess">Hello, Lustra!</div>
    ```

    This ensures you're using Lustra's system and avoids conflicts.
